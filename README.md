# üê≥ Nodemon Docker

Node.js local development on docker container and nodemon

You don't need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your machine to develop Node.js, just using only [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Start developing on local machine
Before you begin, you need to make sure you have installed [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

Start project, run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

In case if you want to use npm or Node.js commands.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app <YOUR-DESIRED-COMMAND>
```
ex. `docker-compose run app npm install jest --save`

If you want to re-build the container please stop the current one and run the following command below.
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
